# Alexa Trivia Game Hack-a-Thing-2

The project follows the step-by-step guide on this ![repository](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia).
We have modified the tutorial such that our game now quizzes players on Dartmouth trivia rather than reindeer trivia.

## Getting started
Amazon Alexa device must be successfully registered under the developer's account.
Start the trivia game with the following prompt: "Alexa, open Dartmouth Trivia".

## Playing the game
Upon reading a question, Alexa will request a number corresponding to the answer choices that have been read out.

## Issues
Game does not automatically quit upon hearing the "Alexa, stop" prompt.
